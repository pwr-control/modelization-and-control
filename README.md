# Modelization and control
This repo contains a collection of models and control applications developed in a multi domain physics environment based on Matlab/Simscape. 
The repo contains applications on: power electronics, hydrostatic systems, and control system engineering.

**How to use the repo**:
- In matlab add to the path/with-subfolders the repo "library". This repo contains all fundamentals simscape (ssc) models compiled with "ssc_bultd".
- The folder ./library/user_defined_functions/ccaller contains a list of c-coded functions used inside the simulink models by ccallers.
- The folder ./library/foundation contains all simscape language based model used in the simulink models.

 # Documentation
Documentation is available into the **library** repository.
